## Task 4 

To answer the first question, I created a small react component with the logic you described

In large applications, need to create one child component which, through props, receives all the necessary data: price, name and pictures.
All data will be passed from parent components.Of course, we can take ready-made cards from bootstrap or MaterialUI. 
It is need to adjust the size of the pictures so that everything loads quickly.

I think one aspect is that if you want to switch between 3 and 4 products per row you are actually switching between 30 and 40 products on page.
So we can store it in state and switch our state by the click on the Button. And redner as many products, as we need.
Main question is we will remove the right column? Or last 10 products? It's a design decision

I hope i'm understand all that you expect from me.
